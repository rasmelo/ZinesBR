                             PUMA Shareware
                                Presents:
                             UNIX - COMMANDS

Congratulations on selecting a PUMA Shareware product.  At PUMA we
are dedicated to producing quality software that is straight-
forward and easy to use so that the student can concentrate on
mastering the lessons.  You can master the program in less than
5 minutes and will not find lots of switches or options to learn.

UNIX Commands is a FLASHCARD program that will teach you the
command language of the UNIX operating system.  It is designed to
be a companion to a good UNIX reference manual.  By memorizing
some 150 commands you will save many hours of wading through
technical documentation.

Like DOS is the underlying language of PC's UNIX is the operating 
system of most of the systems on the internet.  UNIX is a must for
serious internet trailers.

This shareware version contains two sample lessons.  Registered 
users will receive the full six lesson course and receive a
discount on the advanced UNIX course containing over 700 UNIX 
commands, switches and options.

To run the first lesson, enter:  LESSON1
Documentation: README.TEXT


Getting started:

At startup you will be given two options.  The first is the level
(1 - 5) and the second is whether you want Definition or Command
input.  If you are a beginner, the Command input will be a bit
easier.  You should however alternate Command and Definition input
until you master the cards in both modes.

The only other thing you need to know is how to get out of the 
program if you want to return to the operating system.  That's 
easy, press <CTRL e> followed by <Enter>.

So you start up and are presented with a question, and you haven't
got a clue.  Take a wild guess or just press the enter key.  
FLASHCARD will beep and display the correct "Answer" above your 
input.  The cursor then travels to the upper right corner of the 
screen where it waits for you to <hit any key>.  Note the
difference between your input and the correct answer and then bump
a key for the next question.

You will likely strike out several times before you complete the 
set successfully.  When you make a error, the question will repeat
after a few times.

In each lesson, the student is presented with 5 sets of 5 cards.
Each set is called a level and the program randomly selects from
the 5 cards, 25 times.  The object is to complete the 25
questions without incurring more that two errors (three "Strikes"
and you're out).  If you get the third strike, the high score is
updated and you start over.  Typically you would start with level
one and repeat it until you have "Successfully" completed it 10
times.

At level two, you will be presented with a second set of 5 cards.
At level two you work your way through the 2nd set and then the 
first set (you already know these), until you have completed both
sets "Successfully" 10 times.

By the time you get to level 5 you will work your way from level 5
level 4 to level 3 to level 2 to level 1.  As you progress 
through the series, the questions seem easier.


Review:

When you have mastered lesson 1 continue with lesson 2.  I like to
go back and review all previous lessons after completing a lesson.
The repetition and review will quickly make these commands yours
to command.
